## boilerplate draft for meteor + angular + typescript 

Based on latest [angular2 now](https://github.com/pbastowski/angular2-now/tree/meteor1.2). From original angular2 now documentation it is not obvious (especially
 to meteor newbie) how to setup project to use TypeScript and also benefot from Intellij IDEA features related to all of it. 

This is project template that connect all the stuff together including TypeScript typings provided as meteor modules, DefinitelyTyped and just found in other places.

/typings contains `d.ts` files unavailable to be added using meteor dependencies. As for now typings contains both
typings resolved from DefinitelyTyped repo and manually downloaded files as well

It's also worth to read [angular-meteor](http://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular2/bootstrapping) tutorials for both Angular 1 & 2 versions
